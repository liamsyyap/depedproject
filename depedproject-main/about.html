			<h3>THE DEPED VISION</h3>
			<p>
				We dream of Filipinos<br/>
				who passionately love their country<br/>
				and whose values and competencies<br/>
				enable them to realize their full potential<br/>
				and contribute meaningfully to build the nation.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a learner-centered public institution,<br/>
				the Department of Education<br/>
				continuously improves itself<br/>
				to better serve its stakeholders.
			<hr>
			
			<h3>THE DEPED MISSION</h3>
			
			<p>
				To protect and promote the right of every Filipino to quality, equitable, culture-based, and complete basic education where:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>Students</b> learn in a child-friendly, gender-sensitive, safe, and motivating environment.<br/>
				<b>Teachers</b> facilitate learning and constantly nurture every learner.<br/>
				<b>Administrators and staff</b>, as stewards of the institution, ensure an enabling and supportive environment for effective learning to happen.<br/>
				<b>Family, community, and other stakeholders</b> are actively engaged and share responsibility for developing life-long learners.
			</p>

			<h3>OUR CORE VALUES</h3>

				Maka-tao<br/>
				Makakalikasan<br/>
				Makabansa</i>
			</p>

			<h3>OUR MANDATE</h3>
			
			<p>
				The Department of Education was established through the Education Decree of 1863 as the Superior Commission of Primary<br/>
				Instruction under a Chairman. The Education agency underwent many reorganization efforts in the 20th century in order to better<br/>
				define its purpose vis a vis the changing administrations and charters. The present day Department of Education was eventually<br/>
				mandated through Republic Act 9155, otherwise known as the Governance of Basic Education act of 2001 which establishes the<br/>
				mandate of this agency.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The Department of Education (DepEd) formulates, implements, and coordinates policies, plans, programs and projects in the<br/>
				areas of formal and non-formal basic education. It supervises all elementary and secondary education institutions, including<br/>
				alternative learning systems, both public and private; and provides for the establishment and maintenance of a complete,<br/>
				adequate, and integrated system of basic education relevant to the goals of national development.
